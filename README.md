Abstract: The deep complex convolution recurrent network (DCCRN) achieves excellent speech enhancement performance by utilizing the audio spectrum's complex features. However, it has a large number of model parameters. We propose a smaller model, Distil-DCCRN, which has only 30\% of the parameters compared to the DCCRN. To ensure that the performance of Distil-DCCRN matches that of the DCCRN, we employ the knowledge distillation (KD) method to use a larger teacher model to help train a smaller student model. We design a knowledge distillation (KD) method, integrating attention transfer and kullback-leibler divergence (AT-KL) to train the student model Distil-DCCRN. Additionally, we use a model with better performance and a more complicated structure, Uformer, as the teacher model. Unlike previous KD approaches that mainly focus on model outputs, our method also leverages the intermediate features from the modelsâ€™ middle layers, facilitating rich knowledge transfer across different structured models despite variations in layer configurations and discrepancies in the channel and time dimensions of intermediate features. Employing our AT-KL approach, Distil-DCCRN outperforms DCCRN as well as several other competitive models in both PESQ and SI-SNR metrics on the DNS test set and achieves comparable results to DCCRN in DNSMOS.
